JavaScript Data Types:
JavaScript has seven types. They are as follows:
Number
String
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Object
Symbol

Numbers:

A number data type can be an integer, a floating point value, an exponential value, a ‘NaN’ or a ‘Infinity’.

1
2
3
var a=250;  // integer value
var b=25.5;  // a number containing a decimal 
var c = 10e4 //  an exponential value which evaluates to 10*10000

String:

The string data type in JavaScript can be any group of characters enclosed by a single or double-quotes or by backticks.

1
2
3
var str1 = “This is a string1”;  
var str2= ‘This is a string2’;
var str3 = `This is a string3`

Boolean:

The boolean data type has only two values, true and false. 
It is mostly used to check a logical condition.
 Thus Booleans are logical data types which can be used for comparison of two variables or to check a condition.
 typeof(true) // returns boolean
 typeof(false) // returns boolean

Undefined:

Undefined data type means a variable that is not defined. 
The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.
var a;
console.log(a); // This will return undefined.

Null:

The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself.
 A null value means no value.

 Object:

An object in JavaScript contains key-value pairs in its address. 
When we refer to obj1, we are actually referring to the address in memory which contains the value {a: 5, b: 6}, instead of the value {a: 5, b: 6} directly.
var obj1 = { a: 5, b: 6 };

Symbol:

The ‘symbol’ data type is new in es6. 
The symbol data type defines a property of an object which is private to the object. 
It refers to the ‘key’ of the key-value pair of an object.
var object1 = {
   name: ‘Shalini’,
   age: 25,
   city: ‘Mumbai’
}
var occupation=Symbol(‘engineer’);
